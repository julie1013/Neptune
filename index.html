<uh> Dumb Things my Cat Does</uh>
  <ul> Screams at me to feed him even if I'm in the shower</ul>
  <ul> Screams at me to feed him even after I've just fed him</ul>
  <ul> Sits on my chest while I'm trying to sleep</ul>
  <ul> Runs around the apartment building and returns to the wrong unit.</ul>

  <p>I named my cat Neptune, but I should have called him sunny because he thinks everything revolves around him.</p>
